						<div class="col3">
							<p>Recently I use my spare time to build up a ToMaTo testbed using some machines in the lab. I used to have set it up in BUPT, but this time it's much harder. First I found that ToMaTo isn't compatible with the latest version of the underlying Proxmox VE virtualization tools (actually it's the latest version of OpenVZ). Then I found that an older Proxmox VE on Debian contains no driver of the NIC we use. After days of working, I successfully modified some codes in the ToMaTo software and some settings in the latest Proxmox VE, and managed to set up the testbed on two machines. It works very well.</p>

							<p>As the days go close to the end of the term, I have to begin my process of dealing with the term assignment for one of the communications cources. The course required that every work group to develop a program that simulate the basic function of a cellphone.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, the tools we need to use is some kind of graphical language. Telelogic SDL and TTCN Suite is said to be a powerful tool for designing telecommunication software. Yet this Suite along with the SDL and MSC languages is very hard to learn. Few materials can be found about the tool.</p>
							<p>After hours of learning, finally I got some ideas in dealing with the assignment. Referring to some badly developped programs on the Internet, I managed to develop my own program. It's still in progress now, but I should be able to make it out before the deadline. God bless me.</p>

							&emsp;2) Several focuses of MPTCP: 3-way handshakes, congestion control (load balancing), deployability, acknowledgement, data distribution, etc.;<br />
							&emsp;3) Datacenters: MPTCP overperforms most other protocols on most topologies, yet not perfect;

							<p>As a senior student, I'm about to start my graduation project recently. After participating in real scientific researches for more than one year, I don't just want to make a junk for my graduation project. It's a precious opportunity, and I really want to do some good work to end my undergraduate life.</p>
							<p>Prof. Dan Li admitted of that I do my graduation project under his supervision. He sent me several papers about <b>Datacenter Multipath/Routing</b>, asking me to read them carefully and discuss with him later. Due to my health issue, I haven't started to read the papers yet, but I plan to begin investigating this week.</p>
							<p>Prof. Li want me to submit a paper about this research to INFOCOM the next year. This year, many papers from our group have been rejected by INFOCOM, so I don't have much confident now in carrying out such a research independently. But I'm sure that at least I'll get a lot through this experience. And of course, maybe I can really get a INFOCOM paper when I'm going to the U.S ~</p>

							<p>I'm greatly sorry for not updating my homepage for such a long time. The truth is that I got a serious <span style="color:red">enterogastritis</span> these days.</p>
							<p>It's quite a serious case. I've never got a diarrhea that cost me three days to recover, nor have I vomitted at the same time. I even got a fever at the first day. In three days, I ate and drank nothing but soaked glucose. Thank god I'm feeling better now. Though not fully recovered, I shall be fine in several days (due to the doctor).</p>
							<p>These days I've been forced to stop all my current work to heal my body. Lots of work has been paused. As I'm turning better, more and more things are coming to me, making a mass in my brain. But anyway, all these have to be done. So no complaints! I'll be back to work soon !</p>

						<div class="col2"><span style="color:red">DO NOT</span> turn a networking problem into a mathematical kink !</div>
						<div class="col3">
							<p>Today we met again for the Deadline-aware Transportation in Datacenter (DaTDC) project. My task of this week is to build a 0-1 programming model for the global optimization. Unfortunately, after a week of working on it, I found it very hard of doing so. I expected to bring in a variable representing the possible start time of every flow in the network. But this made the optimization a mass. The start time is hard to define and hard to calculate, and thus is not an applicable idea.</p>
							<p>On the other hand, Lili Liu've built another programming model. To reduce the problem space, she split the timeline into time slots, turning the real-number problem into a integer one. In this case, the programming hardness reduces, and so does the accuracy of the optimization.</p>
							<p>Prof. Dan Li doubted the motivation of doing so (and so did I at first). Later, the discussion turned into a mathematical one. We aimed at proving that some of the important properties of the problem can't be met unless we turn the problem into a integer one. We talked about NP and NPC, we thought about the Turing machine proof, and we tried to prove several theorems that we didn't even know how to describe. At last, we gave up doing so as we found that the core of the problem shouldn't be so mathematical. It's too hard to approach the solution in a method of pure mathematics.</p>
							<p>Therefore, we decided to ask the authors of "PDQ" the paper for their approach of programming. They made a programming benchmark in their paper, which should also help in solving our problem. Maybe Prof. Caesar can give us some answers ~</p>

							<p>Ok, I get a plan. I'll try to make stars as long as I'm spare. Each star will contain some of my feelings of Ray or of us two. It'll be a lot of stars long after, and it'll be my gift to her on the Valentine's Day. That's great!</p>

							<p>Today's task is to find an appropriate evaluation function of the network. After hours of discussion and investigation, we found that any convex function with the property of monotonically increasing can serve the constraints. log(C/N) may be a good choice, but we found (C/N)^0.5 to be a better choice since that N*(C/N)^0.5 still remain the property of monotonically increasing, which partly solve the problem of resource saving.</p>

After only few hours of listening and asking last afternoon, and a night of investigating and thinking on the problem last night, I had made out some slides and presented them on today's meeting. Most of the contect of the slides were questions that I didn't understand quite clearly.</p>
							<p>It's fortunate that my questions did do some favor. Prof. Li raised a new problem from my questions, solidating the previous problem model by adding more concerns. It was great that <strong>Prof. Li praised me for my getting started quickly</strong>, which have brought me great confidence. I was worried that I couldn't help much in this project. Now I know that I can make some contributions, and I'm very willing to help more.</p>

							<p>After discussion with Prof. Dan Li, I decided to assist in two more projects, both working for the SIGCOMM conference the next year. One project is about datacenter virtualization, working on how to allocate VMs in order to provide high utilization for both the server capacity and the bandwidth. This project is a sequel of Senior Jing Zhu's ICNP 2012 paper, <i>Towards Bandwidth Guarantee in Multi-tenancy Cloud Computing Networks</i>. Right now 7 members have already been working on this, and Prof. Li wants me to provide some help in the higher level to make some breakthrough to the current bottlenecking part.</p>
							<p>Another project is Senior Jing Zhu's fast reroute project. The day after tomorrow will be our first time discussion. Hope I can provide some help in this project as well.</p>
							<p>Actually, it adds much pressure on me, as I'm already very busy working on all the appliction issues such as online application, mailing materials and contacting with professors. Yet I find myself unable to give up this chance for more interesting researches. Actually I've heard about the two projects for some time, and do have some will to join in them.

						<div class="col2">The Hardest Path</div>
						<div class="col3">
							<p>Yesterday, Junjie Guan told me that he feared he lack the talent for being a Ph.D. It reminded me of the time when I doubted myself as well. Yes it's quite hard of doing researches, perhaps the hardest job in the world. Look at all those great men and women and we surely understand what sort of hardness are we dealing with, and what sort of success are we pursuing. It's never been easy to <i style="color:red;">change the world</i>.</p>
							<p><strong>But then what?</strong> Is it really so unreachable? Well, maybe it's some kind of arrogance of the young, but I do still believe that <i>there's a will, there's a way</i>. I think the differences among people are only a matter of determination and efforts. Try to change oneself and try hard, and no one won't suceed at last. So these days when I was tackling with those tiresome application issues, when I was working on hard mathematical problems for hours, I always told myself these words:</p>
								<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;">
								&emsp;Will means a clear direction,<br />
								&emsp;and the resolution to get a solution.<br />
								&emsp;Hope is essential and so does confidence,<br />
								&emsp;but nothing goes without exertion.</p>
							<p><i>I shall fight whatever is in my way</i>, even it's my own weakness and indolence. I know what I have and what I lack right now, and it's my best chance to change myself through this process. So bless me, for my will and for that I'll defeat myself at last.</p>
							<p style="color:#930000;"><strong>P.S.</strong>: Dear Guan, are you kidding me that you don't have talents for Ph.D? You're the best undergraduate researcher among all I've seen. You can be very still, working on a single problem for hours and days, and you always have the desire to understand it. Ah, it's such a bad thing to compete with you...</p>
